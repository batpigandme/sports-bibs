abstract = {Decision-making in the National Basketball Association (NBA) occurs in the three general contexts of player evaluation, team evaluation, and roster construction. This thesis will explore the interaction of two primary methods of evaluating basketball—“advanced analytics” and “traditional evaluation methods”—that must be integrated together to reduce risk in decision-making and achieve competitive advantage. “Advanced analytics” does not have a precise definition, but can broadly be defined in this thesis as “insights gained from quantitative data analysis about basket in this thesis as “insights gained from quantitative data analysis about basketball.” “Traditional evaluation methods” include any form of observation, such as on-site scouting, live coaching, and game film analysis. Through an interview and survey protocol, this thesis explores methods for quantifying human intangibles, the role of “gut instinct,” NBA organizational structures, as well as the specific strategies and tools in place for key decision-makers to balance all available information. The findings of this thesis are that NBA organizations should formalize their decision- making processes with repeatable strategies and specific tools that align with the strategic plan and vision of the organization, in order to maximize team performance and pursue NBA championships.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVESTo create a more rigorous model of early career success among players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) using growth mixture models. To test the extent to which NBA careers can be predicted by variables that represent past performance and variables that might represent untapped potential. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN$\backslash$nArchival data was collected from measures taken at the pre-draft NBA combine and publicly available data on college and NBA performance. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD$\backslash$nThe first three years of players' NBA careers from 2001 to 2006 draft classes were analyzed using a growth mixture model with collected variables predicting latent class. The estimated parameters were then used to forecast the 2007 to 2010 draft classes. Draft order was also predicted with the same variables. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nNBA player skill formed 3 latent classes of players; only one class performed well in the NBA. Membership in the strongest class was only predicted by age, quality of college program, and players' college performance. Latent class probabilities predicted NBA career trajectory slightly better than draft order in both the estimation model and in the forecast model. NBA draft order was predicted by the same variables as well as arm span and agility. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS$\backslash$nNone of the variables analyzed supported an “untapped potential” hypothesis. There is clear evidence for roles of training environment and the stability of skill. The data is consistent with views of deliberate practice and skill acquisition and appears to be consistent with data showing the benefits of being identified as talented, such as the Matthew effect.},

@article{Vracar2016,
abstract = {We present a methodology for generating a plausible simulation of a basketball match between two distinct teams as a sequence of team-level play-by-play in-game events. The methodology facilitates simple inclusion into any expert system and decision-making process that requires the performance evaluation of teams under various scenarios. Simulations are generated using a random walk through a state space whose states represent the in-game events of interest. The main idea of our approach is to extend the state description to capture the current context in the progression of a game. Apart from the in-game event label, the extended state description also includes game time, the points difference, and the opposing teams' characteristics. By doing so, the model's transition probabilities become conditional on a broader game context (and not solely on the current in-game event), which brings several advantages: it provides a means to infer the teams' specific behavior in relation to their characteristics, and to mitigate the intrinsic non-homogeneity of the progression of a basketball game (which is especially evident near the end of the game). To simplify the modeling of the transition distribution, we factorize it into terms that can be estimated with separate models. We applied the presented methodology to three seasons of National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of forecasting accuracy and in terms of the plausibility of the generated simulations.},

@article{Heit1994,
abstract = {We investigated the task of predicting the outcomes of sporting events, in particular, basketball games. In two experiments, college students predicted the outcomes of a series of National Basketball Association (NBA) games. Following each prediction, the subject received feedback in the form of the actual outcome of the NBA game. After a period of initial learning about the relative strengths of the teams, the subjects were surprisingly successful in their predictions. We examined expert-novice differences by comparing the published predictions of professional oddsmakers to the predictions of the experimental subjects. The average predictions by the subjects were approximately as accurate as the predictions of experts. Finally, we applied a mathematical model, developed originally as an account of simpler learning experiments, to the subjects' responses. We found that the course of the subjects' learning about the teams was well-described by this model. People are able to learn about the structure of a domain by putting together sources of partial information. For example, it is possible to discover the hierarchical structure of an organization or large family by observing pairwise interactions between mem-bers of the organization or family. Likewise, people can infer a linear ordering or ranking of objects along a single dimension by merely observing the outcomes of comparisons or contests between pairs of objects or participants. One type of linear order arises in dominance hierarchies, where the members of a set compete against each other for some scarce resource, and the winner is determined probabilistically from his or her quality along some dimension such as speed, power, or ability. The clearest cases of this kind occur in sports in which individual players or teams compete repeatedly, with an explicit winner and margin of victory.

Several past studies have modeled this relationship for the games played during the March Madness tournament, and this work aims at verifying if the models advocated in these papers still perform well for regular season games. Indeed, most previous articles have shown that a simple quadratic regression model provides fairly accurate predictions of the margin of victory when team rankings only range from 1 to 16. Does that still hold true when team rankings can go as high as 351? Do the model assumptions hold? Can we find semi- or non-parametric methods that yield even better results (i.e. predicted margins of victory that more closely resemble actual results)?

Next, under different sets of true underlying game probabilities, we simulate tournament outcomes and imputed pool standings, in an effort to determine how much of an entry's success can be attributed to luck. While one of our two submissions finished first in the Kaggle contest, we estimate that this winning entry had no more than about a 12{\%} chance of doing so, even under the most optimistic of game probability scenarios.},

Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN. Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we use "fading." By using gradient ascent, we were able to discover what the CNN filters look for during training. Last, we find that a combined FNN+CNN is the best performing network with an error rate of 26{\%}.},

Ball possessions were classified whether including inside pass (n=808) or not (n=3399). Predictive analysis of use and effectiveness was made through a series of binomial logistic regressions and Classification tree analysis (CHAID). Results indicate that ball possessions including inside pass were more effective and longer in duration, finding a greater use in top-4 NBA teams regardless the game period. Additionally, inside pass effectiveness was influenced by: the receiver attitude, reception distance, and defensive help. Particularly, the analysis of combined performance indicators disclosed relevant information on attack effectiveness, suggesting players to adopt a dynamic attitude in the weak side before getting the ball, while their teammates are developing individual and collective actions to create free space and enhance inside game options and effectiveness. Current findings shed some light on specific knowledge concerning tactical behaviours in NBA basketball, contributing in the design of specific programmes to increase inside game options and players' decision- making according to specific game constraints.},

abstract = {This study represents one of the first quantitative field tests of the sunk-cost effect. We tested whether the amount teams spent for players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) influenced how much playing time players got and how long they stayed with NBA franchises. Sunk costs were operationalized by the order in which players were selected in the college draft. Draft order was then used to predict playing time, being traded, and survival in the NBA. Although one might logically expect that teams play and keep their most productive players, we found significant sunk-cost effects on each of these important personnel decisions. Results showed that teams granted more playing time to their most highly drafted players and retained them longer, even after controlling for players' on-court performance, injuries, trade status, and position played. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for both sunk-cost research and the broader literature on managerial decision making.

The language specifies for each player their initial starting spots, trajectories, and timing, with iteration as needed. A key component is acceleration. To determine optimal starting spots, I compute burst locations on the court where players tend to accelerate or decelerate more than usual. Cluster analysis on those burst points compared to all points reveals a difference in which areas of the court see more intense action. The primary burst clusters appear to be the paint, the top of the key, and the extended elbow and wing area. I document the most frequently accelerating players, positions, and teams, as well as the likelihoods of acceleration and co-acceleration during a set play and other components intended to collectively lead to an algorithmic taxonomy.},

This expanded data set allows analysts to use unique performance metrics in models to estimate and classify player performance. Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality metrics has not produced promising results. The classifications presented in the paper use newly introduced defensive metrics to find different defensive positions for each player. Without knowing the number of categories that players can be cast into, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be applied to find the optimal number of clusters.

Second, time-variation is introduced into the model by introducing a dynamic state space model for team strengths. The in-sample results based on eight seasons of NBA data provide weak evidence for heteroscedasticity, which can lead to notable differences in estimated win probabilities. However, persistent time variation is only found when combining the data of several seasons, but not when looking at individual seasons. The models are used for forecasting a large number of regular season and playoff games and the common finding in the literature that it is difficult to outperform the betting market is confirmed. Nevertheless, a forecast combination of model based forecasts with betting odds can lead to some slight improvements.},

abstract = {Abstract The aim of this study was to identify within-season differences in basketball players' game-related statistics according to team quality and playing time. The sample comprised 5309 records from 198 players in the Spanish professional basketball league (2007–2008). Factor analysis with principal components was applied to the game-related statistics gathered from the official box-scores, which limited the analysis to five factors (free-throws, 2-point field-goals, 3-point field-goals, passes, and errors) and two variables (defensive and offensive rebounds). A two-step cluster analysis classified the teams as stronger (69±8 winning percentage), intermediate (43±5 winning percentage), and weaker teams (32±5 winning percentage); individual players were classified based on playing time as important players (28±4 min) or less important players (16±4 min). Seasonal variation was analysed monthly in eight periods. A mixed linear model was applied to identify the effects of team quality and playing time within the months of the season on the previously identified factors and game-related statistics. No significant effect of season period was observed. A team quality effect was identified, with stronger teams being superior in terms of 2-point field-goals and passes. The weaker teams were the worst at defensive rebounding (stronger teams: 0.17±0.05; intermediate teams: 0.17±0.06; weaker teams: 0.15±0.03; P=0.001). While playing time was significant in almost all variables, errors were the most important factor when contrasting important and less important players, with fewer errors being made by important players. The trends identified can help coaches and players to create performance profiles according to team quality and playing time. However, these performance profiles appear to be independent of season period.},

Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the "price of anarchy" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency.},

The data employed for the analysis were composed of 2187 cases (27 players*81 games), having followed a filtering process. We dealt with a balanced study design with repeated measurements given that each player was observed the same number of games, and therefore the player was considered as a random effect. We carried out mixed models to quantify the variability in points and win score among players. Minutes played, the usage percentage and the difference of quality between teams were the main factors for variations in points made and win score. The interaction between player position and age was important in win score. We encourage managers and coaches of sports teams to choose appropriate methods according to their aims. Future research should take into consideration the use of models with random effects on players' characteristics.},

abstract = {In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories: offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments of playmaking (for example, making “smart” passes) are difficult to quantify. It would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams in a game that emphasize initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a node for each of the n players who play in the game and a “goal node”. Arcs between player nodes indicate a pass in the reverse order (turnovers are dealt with separately). Every sport-specific situation (fouls, out-of-bounds, playstoppages, turnovers, missed shots, defensive plays) is addressed, tailored for each sport. As well, some additional arcs are added in to ensure that the associated Markov chain transition matrix is primitive (some power of the matrix has all positive entries) and hence there is a unique PageRank vector, which is used to rate and rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was taken from nine NBA games played between 2014 and 2016. The application shows that this model does indeed provide the type of comprehensive statistic described in the introductory paragraph. Many of the top-ranked players (in the model) in a given game have some of the most impressive traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there are surprises where some players who have impressive stat-lines have lower ranks, and others, who have less impressive stat-lines have higher ranks. Overall, the model provides an alternate tool for player assessment in soccer, basketball and hockey. The model's ranking and ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports statistics.},

We employ a game-theoretical approach using techniques from dynamical systems theory to show that taking more three point shots to a point where an offensive strategy is dependent on predominantly shooting threes is not necessarily optimal, and depends on a combination of payoff constraints, where one can establish conditions via the global stability of equilibrium points in addition to Nash equilibria where a predominant two-point offensive strategy would be optimal as well. We perform a detailed fixed-points analysis to establish the local stability of a given offensive strategy. We finally prove the existence of Nash equilibria via global stability techniques via the monotonicity principle. We believe that this work demonstrates that the concept that teams should attempt more three-point shots because a three-point shot is worth more than a two-point shot is therefore, a highly ambiguous statement.},

abstract = {The quantitative analysis of sports is a growing branch of science and, in many ways one that has developed through non-academic and non-traditionally peer-reviewed work. The aim of this paper is to bring to a peer-reviewed journal the generally accepted basics of the analysis of basketball, thereby providing a common starting point for future research in basketball. The possession concept, in particular the concept of equal possessions for opponents in a game, is central to basketball analysis. Estimates of possessions have existed for approximately two decades, but the various formulas have sometimes created confusion. We hope that by showing how most previous formulas are special cases of our more general formulation, we shed light on the relationship between possessions and various statistics. Also, we hope that our new estimates can provide a common basis for future possession estimation. In addition to listing data sources for statistical research on basketball, we also discuss other concepts and methods, including offensive and defensive ratings, plays, per-minute statistics, pace adjustments, true shooting percentage, effective field goal percentage, rebound rates, Four Factors, plus/minus statistics, counterpart statistics, linear weights metrics, individual possession usage, individual efficiency, Pythagorean method, and Bell Curve method. This list is not an exhaustive list of methodologies used in the field, but we believe that they provide a set of tools that fit within the possession framework and form the basis of common conversations on statistical research in basketball.

For instance, agents often choose mo- tion sequences with long-term goals in mind, such as achiev- ing a certain strategic position. Conventional policy learning approaches, such as those based on Markov decision pro- cesses, generally fail at learning cohesive long-term behavior in such high-dimensional state spaces, and are only effective when myopic planning leads to the desired behavior. The key difficulty is that such approaches use “shallow” planners that only learn a single state-action policy. We instead pro- pose to learn a hierarchical planner that reasons about both long-term and short-term goals, which we instantiate as a hi- erarchical deep memory network. We showcase our approach in a case study on modeling basketball player trajectories, and show that it generates significantly more realistic tra- jectories compared to non-hierarchical baselines as judged by professional sports analysts.},

abstract = {Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks, and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques, and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes, and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others, and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.},

Since 1985, more than 70{\%} of the teams in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rounds of the tournament have been high-seeded teams (i.e., teams assigned seeds of one, two, or three); a method that can accurately compare two such teams is often necessary to predict games in these rounds. This paper statistically analyzes tournaments from 1985 to 2009. A key finding is that there is an insignificant difference between the historical win percentages of high-seeded teams in each of the fourth, fifth, and sixth tournament rounds, which implies that choosing the higher seed to win games between these seeds does not provide accurate predictions in these rounds, and alternate predictors or methods should be sought.

Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic, imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior. This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player specific predictions. Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of NBA players. The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial effects, such as shooting accuracy.},

Neural networks derived from self-organizing maps established themselves as a useful tool to analyse static and temporal data. In this study, we applied the merge self-organising map (MSOM) to spatio-temporal data. To do so, we investigated the ability of MSOM's to analyse spatio-temporal data and compared its performance to the common dynamical controlled network (DyCoN) approach to analyse team sport position data. The position data of 10 players were recorded via the Ubisense tracking system during a basketball game. Furthermore, three different pre-selected plays were recorded for classification. Following data preparation, the different nets were trained with the data of the first half. The training success of both networks was evaluated by achieved entropy. The second half of the basketball game was presented to both nets for automatic classification. Both approaches were able to present the trained data extremely well and to detect the pre-selected plays correctly. In conclusion, MSOMs are a useful tool to analyse spatial-temporal data, especially in team sports. By their direct inclusion of different time length of tactical patterns, they open up new opportunities within team sports.},

abstract = {Every basketball player takes and makes a unique spatial array of shots. In recent years, technology to measure the coordinates of these constellations has made analysis of them possible, and the possibility exists for distinguishing between different shooters at a level of spatial detail finer than the entire basketball court. This paper addresses the challenge of characterizing and visualizing relative spatial shooting effectiveness in basketball by developing metrics to assess spatial variability in shooting. Several global and local measures are introduced and formal tests are pro- posed to enable the comparison of shooting effectiveness between players, groups of players, or other collections of shots. We propose an empirical Bayesian smoothing rate estimate that uses a novel local spatial neighborhood tai- lored for basketball shooting. These measures are evaluated using data from the 2011 to 2012 NBA basketball season in three distinct ways. First we contrast nonspatial and spatial shooting metrics for two players from that season and then extend the comparison to all players attempting at least 250 shots in that season, rating them in terms of shooting effec- tiveness. Second, we identify players shooting significantly better than the NBA average for their shot constellation, and formally compare shooting effectiveness of different players. Third, we demonstrate an approach to map spatial shooting effectiveness. In general, we conclude that these measures are relatively straightforward to calculate with the right input data, and they provide distinctive and useful information about relative shooting ability in basketball. We expect that spatially explicit basketball metrics will be useful additions to the sports analysis toolbox.},

In spite of the challenges and uncertainty faced in this endeavor, patterns exist in how the seeds appear in each round, particularly the later rounds. This paper statistically analyzes tournaments from 1985 to 2010, finding that the distribution of seeds that win in the rounds beyond the Sweet Sixteen can be modeled as a truncated geometric random variable. This model allows one to consider any set of seeds in each tournament round and compute the probability that these seeds would win in that round; this methodology can evaluate the likelihood of each seed combination in each tournament round, based on past tournament history. Finally, each tournament from 1985 through 2010 is analyzed using this model to assess its likelihood and measure the probability of its occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

After developing a general analysis procedure, we present as an example a specific implementation of our method using a simplified network model. While player tracking data is not yet available in the public domain, we evaluate our model using simulated data and show that player skills can be accurately inferred by a simple statistical inference scheme. Finally, we use the model to analyze games from the 2011 playoff series between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Oklahoma City Thunder and we show that, even with a very limited data set, the model can consistently describe a player's interactions with a given lineup based only on his performance with a different lineup.},

abstract = {Although basketball games have received broad attention, the forms of game reports and webcast are purely content-based cross-media: texts, videos, snapshots, and performance figures. Analytical narrations of games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets are challenging for general media producers because such a composition is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular, an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game events, player locations, player profiles, and team profiles, among others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and effective basketball game data visualization made up of different sources of media. Existing visualizations of basketball games mainly profile a particular aspect of the game. Therefore, this paper presents an expressive visualization scheme that comprehensively illustrates NBAgames with three levels of details: a season level, a game level, and a session level.We reorganize a basketball game as a sequence of sessions to depict the game states and heated confrontations. We design and implement a live system that integrates multimedia NBA datasets: play-by-play text data, box score data, game video data, and action area data.We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme with case studies and user feedbacks.},

abstract = {The use of spatial analytics in basketball is becoming more common with the installation of optical tracking devices in all arenas. However, much of the statistical work done on spatial data to date has focused solely on descriptive aspects of the data, thereby providing only basic insights from spatial analytics. This paper presents a predictive Bayesian Belief Network model that uses spatial shooting data to determine optimal shooting zones on a basketball court given exogenous variables, such as the quality of the opposing team or the day of the week on which a game is played, and game data, such as team assists or blocks. The model reveals that regardless of the exogenous variables observed, winning probability is maximized when shooting from under the basket, 3-pointers from the corners and, to a lesser extent, 2-pointers from the corners. Increasing winning probability by shooting from under the basket is a logical and unsurprising finding due to the high number of shots taken per game from this zone and their high conversion percentage, and therefore receives limited attention in this paper. However, the increased winning probability derived from corner shots is an interesting result that could be attributed to the shorter distance of these shots to the hoop, or to a “drive and dish” type play in which shots from these zones face less defensive pressure.},

abstract = {We asked how team dynamics can be captured in relation to function by considering games in the first round of the NBA 2010 play-offs as networks. Defining players as nodes and ball movements as links, we analyzed the network properties of degree centrality, clustering, entropy and flow centrality across teams and positions, to characterize the game from a network perspective and to determine whether we can assess differences in team offensive strategy by their network properties. The compiled network structure across teams reflected a fundamental attribute of basketball strategy. They primarily showed a centralized ball distribution pattern with the point guard in a leadership role. However, individual play-off teams showed variation in their relative involvement of other players/positions in ball distribution, reflected quantitatively by differences in clustering and degree centrality. We also characterized two potential alternate offensive strategies by associated variation in network structure: (1) whether teams consistently moved the ball towards their shooting specialists, measured as "uphill/downhill" flux, and (2) whether they distributed the ball in a way that reduced predictability, measured as team entropy. These network metrics quantified different aspects of team strategy, with no single metric wholly predictive of success. However, in the context of the 2010 play-offs, the values of clustering (connectedness across players) and network entropy (unpredictability of ball movement) had the most consistent association with team advancement. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of network approaches in quantifying team strategy and show that testable hypotheses can be evaluated using this approach. These analyses also highlight the richness of basketball networks as a dataset for exploring the relationships between network structure and dynamics with team organization and effectiveness.},

Then machine learning models mentioned above is trained and tested by consuming data in the data mart. After applying scoring dataset to evaluate the model accuracy, Simple Logistics Classifier finally yields the best result with an accuracy of 69.67{\%}. The results obtained are compared to other methods from different source. It was found that results of this project are more persuasive since such a vast quantity of data was applied in this project.

For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested.

We further explore the impact of the network structure on the prediction accuracy and we show that the cycles in the network are significantly correlated with the performance.

Many factors affect shot success, including the location of the shot, the shot style (e.g., jump shot, finger roll, dunk), and of course the player's skill. Crucially, the list of high- probability shots is different for each player. We predict the success of shot made by NBA basketball players in the 2015-2016 season, and show that using traditional methods such as logistic regression or support vector machine regres- sion is problematic because many style-location-player com- binations do not occur in the training data, i.e., the data are highly sparse. Hence, we propose a shot recommender system based on factorization machines. Factorization ma- chines have been used successfully in recommendation prob- lems because they handle sparse data, scale well to very large datasets, and provide latent factors that capture un- derlying rater (player) preferences and item (shot) features. For the NBA player data, a 25-factor model predicts log- odds of shot success with high accuracy. It also identifies both highly recommended shots and shots to be avoided, in- cluding shots that are not represented in the training data.},

This Article provides an explanation for why the prior literature misjudged the role that union dissolution would play during the 2011 work stoppages. It argues that previous commentators failed to recognize that the frequently cited disadvantages of dissolving a union actually provide minimal disincentive to players during a lockout. The Article concludes by predicting that players will likely continue to dissolve their unions during future lockouts in order to gain negotiating leverage over ownership through the assertion of antitrust claims.},

abstract = {Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns or principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive data set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across these sports, scoring tempo - when scoring events occur - closely follows a common Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoring balance - how often a team wins an event - follows a common Bernoulli process, with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper examines competitive balance in the most prominent basketball league in the world: the NBA. Two types of graphs are used. First, long-term competitive balance is studied based on actual positions achieved by the teams on the Regu-lar Season. On the other hand, the competitive balance levels for each season are analyzed using sport betting odds data and through the use of two alternative strategies. In the first approach, density functions for the number of victories for all teams within a season are known, whereas in the second approach, a kernel density function of team winning probability is deter-mined for each season. Thus, a prospective competitive balance analysis is conducted. The study period covers seasons 1993-94 and 2011-12. The results suggest that long-term competitive balance levels are high, as many teams change their classifications. At season level, competitive balance seems to improve along the period studied. However, there are still too many differences between the teams in the same season. Keywords:},

abstract = {The authors empirically tested Underwood, Bond, and Baer's (2001) social identity–brand equity (SIBE) model in the context of fans of a university men's basketball team. Their model proposes that service marketplace characteristics (venue, team history, rituals, and social groups) enhance one's social identity to a team. This heightened social identity, in turn, is seen to build brand equity of the team brand. Using the SIBE model as a conceptual framework, a comparative study was conducted across 3 distinct fan groups of the team: current students, alumni, and the general public. Results provide strong support for the effect of social identity on brand equity; regardless of the type of fan, a heightened social identity to the team enhanced the perceived equity of the athletic program (i.e., brand) overall. How social identity was formed, however, differed by fan group. For example, team history showed a significant relationship to social identity for alumni and the general public. Students were most influenced by their sense of the basketball program being part of the local community as a whole. These finding are valuable in knowing how to craft marketing communications for various fan constituencies, as well as understanding how identification to 1 team might be leveraged across all sports in a collegiate athletic program.},

abstract = {An important problem facing a basketball team is determining the right proportion of 2 and 3 point shots to take. With many possessions remaining, a team should maximize points—a 3-pointer is simply worth 1.5 2-pointers. 3-point attempts have roughly double the per-shot variance as 2-point attempts, but a team should be “risk neutral.” As time remaining decreases, the trailing team should place an increasingly positive value on risk; the opposite holds for the leading team. Our game theoretic analysis yields a testable optimality condition: 3-point success rate must fall relative to 2-point success rate when a team's preference for risk increases. Using four years of play-by-play data, we find strong evidence this condition holds for the trailing team only. As a lead decreases, the leading team should become more risk-neutral, but teams in this circumstance actually tighten up and become more risk averse, contrary to what their risk preferences ought to be to maximize the chance of winning the game. We also show that if the offense shoots more 3's as it becomes risk-loving this implies the attack can be varied more readily than the defensive adjustment. 3-point usage does increase with the trail team's preference for risk, but actually falls for the leading team. Teams get it right when losing and wrong when winning. We also find a strong motivating effect of losing—the trailing teams displays an overall boost in efficiency for both shot types.},

In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.},

abstract = {The release of NBA player tracking data greatly enhances the granularity and dimensionality of basketball statistics used to evaluate and compare player performance. However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more computational resources and reduces the ability to easily interpret findings. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four principal components that account for 68{\%} of the variation in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily compare statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component dimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players and teams similar or unique. A simple measure of similarity between two player or team statistical profiles based on the four principal component scores is also constructed. The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and intuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data. As new statistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing and new data sources by reconstructing the principal component dimensions and SDI for improved comparisons. Using principal component scores and SDI, several use cases are presented for improved personnel management.},

Current study is an attempt to contribute understanding of sponsorship in sport context and aims to evaluate sport sponsorship effectiveness by investigating antecedents of attitudes towards sponsor and purchase intentions. A conceptual model was developed to examine the effects of factors such as perceived sincerity, perceived fit between the sponsor and sport team and team attachment on attitude towards sponsor and intentions to purchase sponsor's products. The measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis and hypothesized model was tested by using Structural equation modeling (SEM). The data were collected from spectators of a Turkish basketball game in the arena before the start of game. The results suggest that perceived fit and team attachment have positive influence on sincerity perceptions which in turn create positive attitudes toward sponsor and greater purchase intentions for products of sponsor.

abstract = {Researchers commonly use sports betting lines as predictions of the outcome of sporting events. Betting houses set betting lines conditional on bettors ex ante beliefs about game outcomes, which implies that the predictive power of the sports betting market could be an unintended consequence of betting house profit maximization. Using this insight, we propose a new test of the predictive power of the sports betting market, which incorporates a seldom-used piece of complementary betting information: the over/under—the predicted sum of scores for a game. Since the over/under has the same market properties as the betting line, it should be similarly predictive about the actual outcome, while if bettors have different beliefs about this game feature it need not be predictive. Using the universe of betting lines and over/unders on NFL, NBA, NCAA college football, and NCAA college basketball games from 2004-2010, we test the predictive power of the sports betting market in a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) structure that allows us to characterize both features of the betting market simultaneously. Our joint test reveals that while the betting line is an accurate predictor of the margin of victory the over/under is a poor predictor of the sum of scores. We consistently reject the hypothesis that the sports betting market overall functions well as a prediction market.},

EPV allows analysts to evaluate every decision made during a basketball game - whether it is to pass, dribble, or shoot - opening the door for a multitude of new metrics and analyses of basketball that quantify value in terms of points. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for estimating EPV, present results of EPV computations performed using player-tracking data from the 2012-2013 season, adn provide several examples of EPV-derived metrics that answer real basketball questions.},

Standard linear regression methods work well when player substitutions are relatively uncommon and scoring events are relatively common, such as in basketball, but as neither of these conditions exists for hockey, we use an approach that embraces the unique characteristics of the sport. We model the scoring rate for each team as its own semi-Markov process, with hazard functions for each process that depend on the players on the ice. This method yields offensive and defensive player ability ratings which take into account quality of teammates and opponents, the game situation, and other desired factors, that themselves have a meaningful interpretation in terms of game outcomes. Additionally, since the number of parameters in this model can be quite large, we make use of two different shrinkage methods depending on the question of interest: full Bayesian hierarchical models that partially pool parameters according to player position, and penalized maximum likelihood estimation to select a smaller number of parameters that stand out as being substantially different from average. We apply the model to all five-on-five (full-strength) situations for games in five NHL seasons.},

We suggest that sustainability can be transposed beyond the “business case” for the WNBA by highlighting three forms of capital (i.e., economic, cultural, and social) that could be less polarized for the WNBA then for their male counterparts. Finally, we offer a CSR perspective for the WNBA arguing that it could be viewed as a strategic investment for the NBA.},

This facilitates detailed analyses of player movement patterns. In this paper, we focus on the difficult problem of offensive playcall classification. While outstanding individual players are crucial for the success of a team, the strategies that a team can execute and their understanding of the opposing team's strategies also greatly influence game outcomes. These strategies often involve complex interactions between players. We apply techniques from machine learning to directly process SportVU tracking data, specifically variants of neural networks. Our system can label as many sequences with the correct playcall given roughly double the data a human expert needs with high precision, but takes only a fraction of the time. We also show that the system can achieve good recognition rates when trained on one season and tested on the next. 1.},

Team owners struggle every year to Fnd the best balance between winning games, winning championships, training players and hiring coach's all on the base of making money. Teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) earn money through T.V contracts, licensed goods, and Ticket sales. Many diDerent owners in diDerent leagues have their own approaches and goals when the thought of raising attendance at games comes to the question. Mike Ilitch Sr., owner of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Detroit Red Wings and Major League Baseball's (MLB) Detroit Tigers have approached revenue generation through building a team to win a championship with the idea that winning league championships results in increased ticket sales and aGendance (Shea 2007). In soccer this trend of building a team to win a championship can be seen with the arrival of Freddy Adu (DeSchriver 2007) and David Beckham. Ee study done on David Beckham supports my research question looking at when joining the MLS. Since Beckham's star power was already established the research found that bringing Beckham to the Galaxy increased its aGendance because of his popularity and star power (Lawson, Sheehan, {\&} Stephenson 2008). By using the information about Beckham and L.A. Galaxy of importing star power players to the MLS we should look at other leagues to see if similar results appear in other leagues like the NBA.},

abstract = {Tournament design is of crucial importance in competitive sports. The primary goal of effective tournament design is to provide incentives for the participants to maximize their performance both during the tournament and in the time period leading up to the tournament. In spectator sports, a secondary goal of tournament design is to also promote interesting match ups that generate fan interest. Seeded tournaments, in general, promote both goals. Teams or individuals with strong performances leading up to a tournament receive higher seeds which increase their chances of progressing further in the tournament. Furthermore, seeding ensures that the strongest teams or players are most likely to meet in the final rounds of the tournament when fan interest is at its peak. Under some distributions of team or player skill, however, a seeding system can introduce anomalies that could affect incentives. Our analysis of the NCAA men's basketball tournament uncovers such an anomaly. The seeding system in this tournament gives teams with better success in the regular season more favorable first round match ups, but the tournament is not reseeded as the games progress. Therefore, while higher seeds progress to the 2 nd round of the tournament at uniformly higher rates than lower seeds, this relationship breaks down in later rounds. We find that 10 th and 11 th seeds average more wins and typically progress farther in the tournament than 8 th and 9 th seeds. This finding violates the intended incentive structure of seeded tournaments.},

We find strong evidence for its existence in all ten statistical categories we consider. The magnitudes are significant; being “hot” corresponds to between one-half and one standard deviation in the distribution of player abilities. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has found little to no evidence for a hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players whereas baseball does not. We then document that baseball teams do respond to recent success in their opponents' batting performance. Our results suggest that teams use recent performance in a manner consistent with drawing a correct inference about the magnitude of the hot-hand, except for a tendency to overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last 5 attempts).},

As part of its deliberations, the Committee is provided a so-called "nitty-gritty report" for each team, containing numerous team performance statistics. Many elements of this report receive a great deal of attention by the media and fans as the tournament nears, including a team's Ratings Percentage Index (or RPI), overall record, conference record, non-conference record, strength of schedule, record in its last 10 games, etc. However, few previous studies have evaluated the degree to which these factors are related to whether a team actually wins games once the tournament begins. Using nitty-gritty information for the participants in the 638 tournament games during the 10 seasons from 1999 through 2008, we use stepwise binary logit regression to build a model that includes only eight of the 32 nitty-gritty factors we examined. We find that in some cases factors that receive a great deal of attention are not related to game results, at least in the presence of the more highly related set of factors included in the model.

Keeping in mind how important spectators are for team sports, understanding factors that affect game attendance will offer essential clues in terms of increasing spectator attendance. The main purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment. With consideration to this purpose, the present study has tested the validity and reliability of the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and the Points of Attachment Index for Turkish basketball spectators. 197 basketball spectators participated in the study. Confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated that the original models of the measurement tools employed for the study showed an acceptable degree of fit with the data. The internal consistency coefficients of the scales were found to be between 0.59 and 0.80 for the Motivation Scale for Sport Consumption and between 0.53 and 0.88 for the Points of Attachment Index. The canonical correlation analysis only returned a single significant function. The motives aesthetics and escape stood out in terms of the significant function, while the sport type (basketball in this study) stood out in the sense of attachment. Relationships identified between basketball spectators' motives and points of attachment could help sports managers and marketing experts to develop strategies focusing on increasing spectator attendance to their teams' games.},

abstract = {The release of NBA player tracking data greatly enhances the granularity and di-mensionality of basketball statistics used to evaluate and compare player performance. However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be troublesome as it demands more compu-tational resources and reduces the ability to easily analyze and interpret findings. To avoid such circumstances, we must find a way to reduce the dimensionality of the data set while retaining the ability to differentiate and compare player performance. In this paper Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four principal com-ponents that account for over 70{\%} of the variation in player tracking data from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these new dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them the most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily compare player statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component dimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players similar or unique. We use the four principal component scores to construct a simple measure of the similarity between two player statistical profiles, the Statistical Diversity Index (SDI), and average this measure across all players on a team to produce a team level measure of the statistical diversity among its players, the team Statistical Diversity Index (tSDI). The tSDI is found to be positively correlated with winning percentage for the 2013-2014 regular season (p-value 0.01) indicating teams with higher statistical diversity among players generally hold higher winning percentages. We demonstrate potential applications using the prin-cipal component scores to better manage player personnel in terms of statistical diversity. The 2013-2014 Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers are evaluated to determine which dimen-sions they are lacking in statistical diversity and how their personnel changes impact statistical diversity along those dimensions.},

Furthermore, following the sponsorship literature, the role of sport fans involvement on the development of team attachment was examined. Design/methodology/approach Questionnaires were collected from fans of a professional basketball team in Greece (n 14 354). Structural equation modeling was employed in order to test the model fit and estimate the model coefficients. Findings The findings supported the premise that highly attached fans are more likely to develop positive image for their team sponsor, exhibit higher intentions for purchasing and recommending the sponsors products.

The results of the study contribute to our understanding of the role of team attachment and sponsor image in predicting sponsorship outcomes.

In estimating the contract year effect in the NBA, this paper is the first to define rigorously the various states of contract incentives, the ignorance of which has been a source of bias in the literature thus far. It further expands on previous analyses by measuring individual performance more broadly across a range of advanced metrics. Lastly, it attempts to account for the intrinsic endogeneity of playing in a contract year, as better players get longer contracts and are thus NBA contract structure to form an instrument, and by comparing performance to a priori expectations. In this manner, this paper produces the first rigorous finding of a positive contract year phenomenon.

This paper is an attempt to reconcile these competing claims.},

abstract = {Statistical applications in sports have long centered on how to best separate signal, such as team talent, from random noise. However, most of this work has concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one sport to another. In this manuscript, we use betting market data to develop a Bayesian state-space model that can be uniformly applied across sporting leagues to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. Our model can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season, within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest home advantage. Additionally, the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing a new metric for judging league competitiveness that works in absence of factors outside of team control.},

abstract = {The relative standard deviation measure of league parity is persistently higher for the National Basketball Association (NBA) than for the other three major sports leagues in North America. This anomaly spans the last three decades and is not explained by differences in demographic and market characteristics. With a much greater number of scoring attempts in each game, basketball reduces the influence of random out- comes in the number of points scored per game and also season winning percentage. Our simulations demonstrate that lesser parity in the NBA is inherent in the rules of the game so that interleague comparisons must be interpreted carefully.},

@inproceedings{Goldman2011,
abstract = {This paper examines the optimality of the shooting decisions of National Basketball Association (NBA) players using a rich data set of shot outcomes. The decision to shoot is a complex problem that involves weighing the continuation value of the possession and the outside option of a teammate shooting. We model this as a dynamic mixed-strategy equilibrium. At each second of the shot clock, dynamic efficiency requires that marginal shot value exceeds the continuation value of the possession. Allocative efficiency is the additional requirement that at that moment", each player in the line-up has equal marginal efficiency. To apply our abstract model to the data we make assumptions about the distribution of potential shots. We first assume nothing about the opportunity distribution and establish a strict necessary condition for optimality. Adding distributional assumptions, we establish sufficient conditions for optimality. Our results show that the cut threshold" declines monotonically with time remaining on the shot clock and is roughly in line with dynamic efficiency. Over-shooting is found to be rare, undershooting is frequently observed by elite players. We relate our work to the usage curve literature, showing that interior players face a generally steeper efficiency trade off when creating shots.},

@article{Deshpande2016,
abstract = {Traditional NBA player evaluation metrics are based on scoring differential or some pace-adjusted linear combination of box score statistics like points, rebounds, assists, etc. These measures treat performances with the outcome of the game still in question (e.g. tie score with five minutes left) in exactly the same way as they treat performances with the outcome virtually decided (e.g. when one team leads by 30 points with one minute left). Because they ignore the context in which players perform, these measures can result in misleading estimates of how players help their teams win. We instead use a win probability framework for evaluating the impact NBA players have on their teams' chances of winning. We propose a Bayesian linear regression model to estimate an individual player's impact, after controlling for the other players on the court. We introduce several posterior summaries to derive rank-orderings of players within their team and across the league. This allows us to identify highly paid players with low impact relative to their teammates, as well as players whose high impact is not captured by existing metrics.},

@article{Skinner2011,
abstract = {When facing a heavily-favored opponent, an underdog must be willing to assume greater-than-average risk. In statistical language, one would say that an underdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has a larger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team should be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team should be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the score's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for addressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every play in a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of a team's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. This description allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when a particular strategy is employed, and therefore allows one to calculate optimal offensive strategies. This paper develops this method for calculating optimal strategies exactly and then presents a simple heuristic for determining whether a given strategy should be adopted. A number of interesting and counterintuitive examples are then explored, including the merits of stalling for time, the run/pass/Hail Mary choice in American football, and the correct use of Hack-a-Shaq.},

abstract = {No previous study on momentum in team sports has found any valid evidence for a momentum effect—i.e., an effect of success in the past few games, over and above the effect of team quality. We develop an econometric model to determine if there is a momentum effect in the NBA by examining how success over the past few games leads to a higher probability of winning the next game. The model takes into account the home vs. away strengths of the teams in the current game as well as their opponents in the previous games (to calculate measures of “adjusted success over the past few games”). Thus, success in previous games is adjusted for quality of the wins or losses. In addition, we account for rest days before the current game for both teams. Using data over three NBA seasons (2007-2009), we find strong evidence for a positive momentum effect.},

abstract = {I introduce an automated system and interactive tools for NBA teams to better decide who to draft, trade for, and sign as free agents. This automated general manager can serve as an expert- system replacement, a complement to a team's front office, or as a benchmark against actual performance. Backtested over ten years, the automated GM outperforms every single team, and by substantial margins. From draft decisions alone, the average team lost about {\$}130,000,000 worth of on-court productivity relative to what they could have had with the automated GM; this shortfall represents about a quarter of the average franchise value. Historically the automated GM's choices would have produced about twice as much as the human choices actually did: approximately one extra win per year per draft pick. The system is calibrated using an innovative extension of traditional machine learning methods, applied to a uniquely broad historical database incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, in a way that avoids survivorship bias, and for a variety of performance metrics; it is thus robust, comprehensive, realistic, and does not overfit information from the future.
